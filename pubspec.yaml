  # example:
  
    # - family: Schyler
    #   fonts:
    #     - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
    #     - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
    #       style: italic
    # - family: Trajan Pro
    #   fonts:
    #     - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
    #     - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
    #       weight: 700
  fonts:
